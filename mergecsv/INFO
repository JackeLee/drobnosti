Requires cabal package called "csv".

If you put all the other attached files in one directory, you can simply run:
   runhaskell mergecsv.hs classwork10.csv
This will produce a file called new-csvofstudents.csv. You can compare
it with the original file csvofstudents.csv to see changes made by the
script.

Tuning how the script merges the files is done by modifying the
constants at the beginning of the Haskell file.
